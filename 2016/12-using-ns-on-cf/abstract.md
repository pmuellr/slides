Cloud Foundry is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering that provides an application management layer over a variety of infrastructure platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, as well as running on your own hardware platform including OpenStack and vSphere.  Applications that run on Cloud Foundry can be written in many languages, including Node.js - which has been a supported runtime for Cloud Foundry since the early days.

In this presentation, Patrick will cover some basics about using Node.js on Cloud Foundry, followed by some nitty gritty on optimizing your Node.js development experience. He will also discuss how to gain insight into memory usage and performance of your Cloud Foundry Node.js applications using NodeSource N|Solid.

Key topics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Understanding the Cloud Foundry and how to run Node.js applications on it.
* Up and running with a Node.js Hello World application running on Cloud Foundry.
* Optimizing your development cycle when pushing applications to Cloud Foundry.
* Diagnose performance and memory issues of your Cloud Foundry Node.js applications with N|Solid.

Patrick Mueller works at NodeSource as a Senior Node Engineer.  He has been fooling around on the internet since the late 1980â€™s, and doing Node.js development on Cloud Foundry since 2013.  He worked at IBM for 30 years, developing a variety of software platforms including IDEs, mobile runtimes and libraries, and server platforms.  He can bore you to death talking about how great development in Smalltalk was.
