Saving Customers and Money by Making It Go Faster
================================================================================

Your application's performance is key to keeping customers happy and reining in hardware costs.  Customers frustrated with slow applications just stop using them.  Poorly performing applications require more machines to run them, compared to optimized applications.

In order to fix poor performance problems, you first have to identify them.  For many programming environments, this involves using specialized tools and environments and sometimes experts, to analyze the application.  For JavaScript, we are fortunate to have CPU profiling tools baked right into the JavaScript runtimes, allowing every developer to do performance analysis.

In this talk we'll go over profiling tools available for Node.js and the browser.  We'll show a brief demo of how these tools can be used to find the slow code in an application, at both development time and in production.
